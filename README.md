<h6>A compiler for simple automation scripts</h6>

<b>"SimpleScript" is in its essense a compiler for predefined set of actions that one would like to run automatically - simple automation scripts. It employs the java.awt.Robot class for most of the supported functionality, but furthermore it also provides capabilities for basic 2D drawing and performing/scheduling up execution of external applications(by creating new processes) and/or visiting web pages. </b>  

The original idea for this compiler was to serve as a practice tool / visual aid for "Computer Peripherals" course at Technical University of Sofia. Students have a predefined list of simple scenarios to automate via relatively short scripts. There is a very loose implementation of a programming language("scripType") integrated in the application helping them do just that by providing a facade of straightforward commands.
