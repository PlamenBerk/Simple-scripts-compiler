# Simple-scripts-compiler
<h6>A compiler for simple automation scripts</h6>

**SimpleScript is a compiler for predefined set of actions that one would like to run automatically - simple automation scripts. It employs the `java.awt.Robot class` for most of the supported functionality, but furthermore it also provides capabilities for basic 2D drawing, executing external programs(as new processes) and visiting web pages.**     

By original design the compiler was ment to serve as a practice tool / visual aid for _"Computer Peripherals"_ course at [_**Technical University of Sofia**_](http://tu-sofia.bg/). It will be used for topics involing keyboard / mouse usage.   

Students would have a predefined list of simple scenarios to automate via relatively short scripts. There is an implementation of a programming language(_**scripType**_), designed and integrated in the application, helping them achieve that by providing a facade of straightforward and easy-to-use commands.
